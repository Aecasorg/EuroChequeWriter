# EuroChequeWriter
Simple iOS app that converts numbers into written text in order to writes cheques in French, German and Spanish.

My first iOS project. Actually my first independent project ever. Very excited. 

This app was born from the frustration that when having moved to France realising that France still used cheques very extensibly. I struggled to write out the numbers in text on the cheques and since I had a UK mobile I could not look it up on internet. Additionally, not speaking French, I found the French numbering system very clumsy and hard to remember. Who says four-twenty-ten in order to get seventy?! English, Spanish and German are much easier. Anyhow, as I was learning to code this I thought would be a perfect first coding project on my own. 

The conversion classes were first written in Java and once I decided I needed to learn Swift and I had come far enough into my iOS dev course I converted the classes (read: rewrote) into Swift. I needed to hard code the translations so I didn't need an internet connection. Many many if and else statements! ;)

Eventually I got the app working pretty well so now it is only sorting the layouts of the buttons that remains. (Find it hard to group 4 buttons in XCode.)

It was really interesting to see the differences in numbering between the languages (non-coding languages). I also really enjoyed making an app that solved a real problem, although I've only used it once since...

Please feel free to dive into the code of this simple little app.
